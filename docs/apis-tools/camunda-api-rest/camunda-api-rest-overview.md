The Camunda 8 REST API is a REST API designed to interact with a Camunda 8 cluster.

:::note
Ensure you [authenticate](./camunda-api-rest-authentication.md) before accessing the Camunda 8 REST API.
:::

:::note
The Camunda 8 REST API only supports user tasks managed by Camunda (formerly known as [Zeebe user tasks](/apis-tools/migration-manuals/migrate-to-camunda-user-tasks.md), which may still appear as such in your XML content).
:::

## Context paths

### SaaS

Find your **region Id** and **cluster Id** under **Connection information** in your client credentials (revealed when you click on your client under the **API** tab within your cluster).

Example path: `https://${REGION_ID}.zeebe.camunda.io:443/${CLUSTER_ID}/v2/`

### Self-Managed

The context path should match the host and path defined in your Zeebe Gateway [configuration](/self-managed/setup/guides/ingress-setup.md). The path used here is the default.

Example path: `http://localhost:8080/v2/`

## API Explorer

See [the interactive Camunda 8 REST API Explorer][camunda-api-explorer] for specifications, example requests and responses, and code samples of interacting with the Camunda 8 REST API.

### Deployment API

You can change the `maxMessageSize` default value of 4MB in the [Gateway](../../self-managed/zeebe-deployment/configuration/gateway.md#zeebegatewaynetwork) and [Broker](../../self-managed/zeebe-deployment/configuration/broker.md#zeebebrokernetwork) configuration.

If you do change this value, it is recommended that you also configure the [Deploy resources](./specifications/create-deployment.api.mdx) REST endpoint appropriately. By default, this endpoint allows single file upload and overall data up to 4MB.

You can adjust this configuration via the following properties:

```properties
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=4MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=4MB
```

For example, if you increase the `maxMessageSize` to 10MB, increase these property values to 10MB as well.

## API Key Attributes

OpenAPI key attributes are defined as `string`. In previous versions key attributes were defined as `integer (int64)`.

In order to have a gradual change and provide our users enough time, we have introduced new content types in our API
specification. With these content types users can specifically tell our API to accept and return `integer (int64)` or
`string` key attributes.

:::info Deprecation
Keep in mind, that objects with key attributes as `integer (int64)` are marked deprecated and **will be removed
in a future release**.
:::

### Content Type Headers

We support the following 3 content types in C8 API:

- `application/json`:
  - Endpoints accept and return objects with key attributes as default `string`.
- `application/vnd.camunda.api.keys.number+json`:
  - Endpoints accept and return objects with key attributes as `integer (int64)`.
- `application/vnd.camunda.api.keys.string+json`:
  - Endpoints accept and return objects with key attributes as `string`.
  - Same as `application/json`.

Combining multiple headers is not supported.

### Object Naming

The naming of the new objects containing key attributes as `string` is defined according to the following pattern:

- Response objects are always called with a `*Result` postfix. For instance:
  - `UserTaskSearchQueryResponse` with `integer (int64)` keys.
  - `UserTaskSearchQueryResult` with `string` keys.
- Request object name postfixes change depending on their function:
  - Search queries: `*SearchQuery`. For instance:
    - `ProcessInstanceSearchQueryRequest` with `integer (int64)` keys.
    - `ProcessInstanceSearchQuery` with `string` keys.
  - Filters: `*Filter`. For instance:
    - `FlowNodeInstanceFilterRequest` with `integer (int64)` keys.
    - `FlowNodeInstanceFilter` with `string` keys.
  - Other payloads: `*Instruction`. For instance:
    - `EvaluateDecisionRequest` with `integer (int64)` keys.
    - `DecisionEvaluationInstruction` with `string` keys.
